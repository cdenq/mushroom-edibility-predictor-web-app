        <b>Data Preword:</b>
        The cleaned mushroom dataset comprised of possible simulated mushroom feature combinations
        (i.e. all possible undiscovered mushrooms). There are over 60k data points, 100+ features,
        (dropped to 86 in the cleaned version), and mostly categorical (eg. color: red, blue, green).
        The massive, multi-featured dataset is not linearly separable.

        <br>
        <b>Going Forward </b> (Unsupervised Learning):
        While we used supervised learning to predict whether mushrooms were edible, we also ran unsupervised learning
        approaches (KMeans and DBSCAN) to explore a future recommendation system -- i.e., a potential next step for this project. A user could
        provide a mushroom not only to understand its edibility but also to recieve recommendations for other similar 
        edible mushrooms they may be interested in.

          As seen in the score comparisons, the RFC and ERFC are the dominant models, likely due to their ability
          to handle noisy data and strong preference for categorical data. The other models, which are much more suited
          for simple, continuous data points, provide a decently powerful model score.

          Given the nature of the data (predicting edibility of mushrooms), we want to avoid false positives (predict
          mushroom is edible, but incorrect). As a result, the biggest score we want to pay attention to is the
          precision score.
          Regarding precision, the RFC/ERFC are highest scoring top models.<br><br>

          We also ran a KNN model to check the number of clusters best identified with the model. From the testing odd
          number of
          k-clusters from 1 to 20, we get a steadily decreasing score graph as the number of clusters increased.
          However, when we
          checked it with the standard calculation (square root of n), we end up with around 116 clusters. This number
          increased
          the classification scores to just under 0.99, suggesting a that testing n-clusters will eventually increase in
          score once again.

          The unsupervised learning approaches
          applied here aim to
          help us understand in what ways (if possible)
          the mushrooms could be grouped for potential
          future recommendation systems.
          We could not find a reasonable number of clusters with the original data
          (no "elbow" point within 30 clusters) and so
          tried to reduce the number of features
          via PCA and TSNE. While creating such composite
          features helped identify and visualize reasonable
          numbers of clusters (~5) for kmeans and dbscan
          clustering and could still be useful for recommending similar mushrooms,
          it also means that we lost the
          ability to full explain the clusters and their
          characteristics (i.e., what characteristics of
          similiarity caused xyz mushrooms to be grouped
          together?).

          More on our Models
        </h5>
      <p>
        Read below to learn more about our models methodologies! <br><br>

        <b>The Random Forest Classifier (RFC)</b>is a supervised learning algorithm that is built form
        an ensemble of decision trees. Individual decision trees take a random subset
        of features from the entire data set and make small predictions; their results are
        then merged together to give an overall, averaged prediction. One major advantage of
        RFC is that it does not assume anything about the data distribution. As such, they
        are non-parametric, can handle skewed data, and can handle categorical and binary data.
        These advantages lead are clear when we look at the resulting scores--the RFC produced
        a strong 1.0 predictive score. <br><br>
  
        <b>The Extremely Random Forest Classifier (ERFC)</b> is similar to the RFC with the exception
        of taking a different random state during every decision tree selection. ERFC is typically
        a more robust model than RFC, and since RFC resulted in a 1.0, the ERFC also did. <br><br>
  
       <b> The Logistic Regression (LR)</b> model is a predictive classifier that uses a sigmoid function in its
        activation. This model is perhaps the most classical supervised model used to predict binary
        results (yes/no). LR has several major assumptions about the model: the features that are measured
        must be independent of each other (little to no collinearity) and the dataset must be largely
        separable with a sigmoid function. LR is also sensitive to noise, and thus, gives us the lowest
        score in all departments. <br><br>
  
        <b>The Support Vector Machine (SVM)</b> is a linear classifierthat attempts to draw a
        line between two groups. It calcaultes the optimal hyperplane which has the max
        margin between distinct clusters, and thus, is heavily dependent on the distribution of the data.
        Just like the LR, the SVM relies on data being linearly separable; unlike
        the LR, SVM is less resistant to noise and thus scores hight. However, SVM is sensitive to
        strong outliers (which luckily our data does not have.)
